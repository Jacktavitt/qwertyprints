        <p>I really didn't know what to do for a few months. I felt that I had let the previous generation of
            entrepreneurs down - that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me. I met with David
            Packard and Bob Noyce and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly. I was a very public failure, and I
            even thought about running away from the valley. But something slowly began to dawn on me - I still
            loved what I did. The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit. I had been rejected, but I
            was still in love. And so I decided to start over.
            I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have
            ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a
            beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my
            life.
            During the next five years, I started a company named NeXT, another company named Pixar, and fell in
            love with an amazing woman who would become my wife. Pixar went on to create the world's first
            computer animated feature film, Toy Story, and is now the most successful animation studio in the
            world. In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT, I returned to Apple, and the technology we
            developed at NeXT is at the heart of Apple's current renaissance. And Laurene and I have a wonderful
            family together.</p>
